## Executive Summary

Bob Diet Coach is an AI-powered diet coaching SaaS that revolutionizes weight management through natural conversation. Unlike traditional calorie counting apps that rely on generic formulas, Bob learns each user's unique metabolism by observing actual weight results, providing truly personalized coaching based on what YOUR scale shows, not what calculators predict.

### Key Differentiators
- **Conversational Interface** - No forms, just natural chat
- **Results-Based Learning** - Calibrates to YOUR actual weight changes
- **Stealth Mode** - For users who prefer not to see numbers
- **Photo Intelligence** - Advanced food recognition that improves over time
- **Real Metabolism Discovery** - Learns what calories actually do to YOUR body

---

## Product Vision & Philosophy

### Core Philosophy: "Chat First, Everything Else Second"

Every interaction happens through natural conversation with Bob. Users talk to him like a knowledgeable friend who remembers their entire diet journey. The UI provides visualizations and history, but the primary interface is always the chat.

### Design Principles

1. **Frictionless Logging** - Speaking is easier than forms
2. **Personalized Intelligence** - Bob learns each user's patterns
3. **Emotional Support** - Encouragement over judgment
4. **Flexible Tracking** - From detailed macros to simple habits
5. **Privacy First** - User data never leaves the platform

### Target Users

- **Primary**: People who've tried calorie counting but found it tedious
- **Secondary**: Those with complex relationships with numbers/weight
- **Tertiary**: Fitness enthusiasts wanting AI-powered optimization

## Core Features - Implemented

### 1. Photo Analysis ✅ [COMPLETED]

Advanced food recognition with intelligent learning:
- **Convex File Storage** for secure image hosting
- **Claude Vision API** for accurate food recognition  
- **Vector similarity search** finds past similar meals
- **One-click confirmation** for frictionless logging
- **Smart error handling** with personality
- **Usage limits** enforced (2/day free, unlimited Pro)

### 2. Weight Tracking ✅

Intelligent weight logging with trend analysis and learning:

```javascript
User: "Weight is 82.5kg today"
Bob: [uses logWeight tool]
"Logged 82.5kg! Your 7-day average is 82.3kg, down 0.4kg from last week.

Based on YOUR results: eating 1,520 avg calories = 0.4kg loss per week.
You're learning exactly how YOUR body responds! 📉"
```

Bob tracks moving averages and learns the relationship between your intake and weight changes.

### 3. Progress Visualization ✅

Real-time progress cards showing:
- Daily calorie progress
- Macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fats)
- Weight trend visualization
- Adherence scoring

### 4. Stealth Mode ✅

For users who prefer qualitative feedback:

```javascript
// Standard Mode
Bob: "You've consumed 1,250 calories with 95g protein"

// Stealth Mode
Bob: "You're on track for the day! Plenty of room for a satisfying dinner 🎯"
```

### 5. Smart Onboarding ✅

Conversational profile building:

```javascript
Bob: "What's your main goal - losing, gaining, or maintaining weight?"
User: "I want to lose 10kg"
Bob: "Great goal! To personalize your plan, I need a few details. What's your current weight?"
// Continues gathering: height, age, activity level, display preferences
```

### 6. Vector Search & Embeddings ✅

All conversations and food logs are embedded for semantic search:

```javascript
User: "What did I eat last time I felt bloated?"
Bob: [searches embeddings]
"Looking at your history, bloating mentions appear after:
- Pizza (3 times)
- Ice cream (2 times)
- Large pasta dishes
Would you like tips for managing this?"
```

### 7. Usage Tracking & Limits ✅

Freemium enforcement:
- 5 AI chats per day (free tier)
- 2 photo analyses per day (free tier)
- Unlimited for Pro users
- Resets at midnight user timezone

## Features in Development

### 1. Photo Analysis 📸 [COMPLETED]

Advanced food recognition with learning capabilities:

```javascript
User: [uploads burger photo]
Bob: [analyzes with Claude Vision + searches similar photos]
"I see a delicious burger! Here's what I'm tracking:
- Burger with bun: 650 calories, 35g protein
- Based on 3 similar photos, this looks like your Five Guys burger (820 cal average)

[Yes, log it!] button

If this isn't accurate, just tell me what to change!"
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Convex File Storage** for secure image hosting (no base64!)
- **Claude Vision API** for food recognition
- **Vector embeddings** for similarity search
- **One-click confirmation** for frictionless logging
- **Smart error handling** ("Hey, that's a selfie!")
- **Usage limits enforced** (2/day free, unlimited Pro)

### 2. Dynamic Metabolism Calibration 🎯 [NEXT PRIORITY]

Bob learns each user's actual metabolism using rolling averages:

```javascript
// After 14 days of data
Bob: "I've noticed something interesting, Sarah. Based on your intake and weight changes, 
your metabolism runs about 200 calories slower than typical calculators suggest. 
I'm adjusting your daily target from 1,500 to 1,300 calories for steady progress. 
This personalization is why I'm different from generic apps!"
```

**Implementation:**
- 7-day rolling averages for weight and calories
- Dynamic calibration triggers (not fixed weekly)
- Confidence scoring based on data quality
- Automatic target adjustments

### 3. Pattern Recognition & Insights 🧠 [PLANNED]

Leveraging embeddings for breakthrough insights:

```javascript
Bob: "I've discovered a pattern! You lose weight most effectively when you:
- Eat protein at breakfast (0.3kg more loss per week)
- Keep dinners under 500 calories
- Have that weekly pizza on Fridays instead of Saturdays"
```

### 4. Plateau Detection & Intervention 📊 [PLANNED]

Automatic detection and science-based solutions:

```javascript
Bob: "You've maintained 78kg for 2 weeks despite perfect adherence. 
This is a normal plateau! I recommend a 2-day refeed at maintenance calories 
to reset your hormones. Trust the process - this works for 85% of users!"
```

### 5. Smart Reminders 🔔 [PLANNED]

Context-aware nudges:

```javascript
// If user typically logs breakfast by 9am but hasn't today
Bob (10am): "Good morning! Haven't seen your breakfast log yet. 
Everything okay, or just running late? ☕"
```

## AI Implementation

### Bob's Agent Architecture

```javascript
const bobAgent = new Agent(components.agent, {
  // Primary model for conversations
  chat: anthropic.chat("claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
  
  // System instructions defining Bob's personality
  instructions: `You are Bob, a friendly and knowledgeable AI diet coach who learns 
  from real results, not generic formulas. You understand that weight change is the 
  ultimate truth, and you adjust recommendations based on what each user's scale 
  actually shows, not what calculators predict...`,
  
  // Tools Bob can use
  tools: {
    confirmFood,          // Parse and confirm food
    logFood,              // Save to database
    logWeight,            // Track weight
    showProgress,         // Display stats
    analyzePhoto,         // Vision analysis
    findSimilarMeals,     // Vector search
    getCalibrationInsights, // Learn from weight results
    getWeightTrends       // Show moving averages
  },
  
  // Embeddings for semantic search
  textEmbedding: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  
  // Allow multi-step operations
  maxSteps: 5,
  
  // Usage tracking for billing
  usageHandler: async (ctx, { userId, usage }) => {
    await trackUsage(ctx, userId, usage);
  }
});
```

### Tool Design Pattern

Each tool follows this structure:

```javascript
export const toolName = createTool({
  description: "Clear description for the AI",
  args: z.object({
    // Zod schema for validation
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, args): Promise<ResultType> => {
    // 1. Validate permissions/limits
    // 2. Perform action
    // 3. Update database
    // 4. Return structured response
  }
});
```

### Conversation Management

- **Threads** persist across sessions
- **Context** includes recent messages + user profile
- **Embeddings** enable semantic search
- **Streaming** for natural feel
