## Testing Your MCPs

### Test Convex:
```
"Show me the last 5 users who signed up"
"How many food logs were created today?"
"List all pro users"
```

### Test Clerk:
```
"Show me active user sessions"
"Check authentication status for user X"
```

```
"What's my MRR?"
"Show recent subscriptions"
"List active pro users from Polar"
```

```
"Read the chat.tsx file"
"Show me the convex schema"
"List all TypeScript files in routes"

## Troubleshooting

If an MCP doesn't work:
1. Check if the npm package exists: `npm info @package-name`
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Check Claude Desktop logs
4. Some MCPs might not exist yet (context7, brightdata, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Add your GitHub token
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Start using MCPs to supercharge your development!

Remember: MCPs make Claude Desktop aware of your project context, so you can ask questions about your actual data and get real answers!
