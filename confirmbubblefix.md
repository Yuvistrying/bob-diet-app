## Auto-Confirmation Bug Fix (2025-06-26)

### Problem

When a user typed "log orange" multiple times, the second (and subsequent) confirmation bubbles would automatically appear in a minimized/confirmed state, making it seem like the AI was auto-confirming food without user input.

### Root Cause

The `getConfirmationId` function in `app/(app)/chat/page.tsx` was generating deterministic IDs based only on food content:

- Same food → Same ID
- If "orange" was confirmed once, its ID (e.g., `confirm-123456`) was added to `confirmedFoodLogs` Set
- Next "orange" would generate the same ID, and the UI would check `confirmedFoodLogs.has('confirm-123456')` → true → show as confirmed

### Solution

Modified `getConfirmationId` to include the message index in the ID generation:

```javascript
// Before: Same food always got same ID
return `confirm-${Math.abs(contentHash)}`;

// After: Each confirmation gets unique ID based on position
return `confirm-${Math.abs(contentHash)}-${messageIndex}`;
```

This ensures:

1. Each confirmation bubble gets a unique ID
2. Persistence still works (IDs are stable for a given message position)
3. Same food logged multiple times won't auto-minimize

### Testing

1. Type "log apple" and confirm it
2. Type "log apple" again - should show new confirmation bubble (not minimized)
3. Refresh page - confirmed items should remain minimized
