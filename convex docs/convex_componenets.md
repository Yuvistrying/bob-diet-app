Frequently Asked Questions
How are components sandboxed?
The Convex runtime ensures that the component tables don't get mixed in with your app's tables. It also ensures that when the component runs its own Convex functions, they are not allowed to access your app's tables without explicit API calls.

What projects should use Components?
If you see a feature listed above, feel free to use it. Check each component's documentation for further guidance.

Can I build my own?
We'd love for you to build your own components to share and list on this page, and even make custom components specific to your project. We are still working on ironing out the authoring apis and will open that up soon.

Do components cost money to use?
Components are open source and are just code and data in your existing backend. They incur relevant usage charges based on how they are implemented and used.

Where can I learn more?
Visit the Components documentation to learn about how Components work, their data isolation model, and how they help you build features faster.
