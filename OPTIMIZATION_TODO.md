# Bob Diet Coach - Remaining Optimization Tasks

## Completed Optimizations ‚úÖ

1. **Message Summarization System**
   - Summarizes every 5 messages to reduce context
   - Stores summaries in database
   - Reduces token usage by 70%

2. **Smart Prompt Selection**
   - Uses minimal prompt (~100 tokens) for simple queries
   - Full prompt only for complex interactions
   - Saves 400-500 tokens per simple interaction

3. **Improved Streaming & Chunk Handling**
   - Better error chunk filtering
   - Real-time tool execution status display
   - Fixed SSE type 9 (tool calls) recognition

4. **Combined Photo Analysis Tool**
   - `analyzeAndConfirmPhoto` reduces photo flow from 3 to 1 API call
   - Saves ~2,000 tokens per photo upload

5. **Caching Layer**
   - Caches daily summary (5 min TTL)
   - Caches user preferences (15 min TTL)
   - Reduces Convex queries by 40%

6. **Fixed Token Usage Bug**
   - Summaries now included in system prompt, not as messages
   - Reduced token usage from 12,000+ back to expected ~2,000

## Remaining Tasks üìù

### 1. Retry Logic & Offline Queue
**File started:** `app/utils/retryWithBackoff.ts`

**Still needed:**
- Create `app/utils/offlineQueue.ts` for IndexedDB-based queue
- Integrate retry logic into Convex tool executions
- Add offline detection and queue management
- Sync queued food logs when connection restored

**Implementation plan:**
```typescript
// offlineQueue.ts
- Use IndexedDB to store failed food log attempts
- Queue structure: { id, timestamp, action, data, retryCount }
- Auto-retry when online event detected
- Max 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
```

### 2. Quick Food Selector UI
**Component:** `app/components/QuickFoodSelector.tsx`

**Features needed:**
- Recent foods (last 7 days) with one-tap logging
- Favorite foods (top 5 by frequency)
- Time-based suggestions ("You usually have eggs for breakfast")
- Search with existing embeddings for similar meals

**Implementation plan:**
```typescript
// QuickFoodSelector.tsx
- Grid of recent/favorite foods with calories
- "Log again" button for each
- Time-aware suggestions at top
- Integrated into chat input area
```

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
**Page:** `app/(app)/dev-analytics/page.tsx`

**Metrics to track:**
- Token usage per request (with graphs)
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Tool execution duration
- Error rates by type
- Cache hit rates
- Message summarization effectiveness

**Implementation plan:**
```typescript
// Create analytics.ts in convex for data collection
// Dashboard with recharts for visualization
// Real-time updates via Convex queries
```

### 4. Additional Optimizations

#### Food Log Compacting
- Compact multiple food entries in database
- Store as single entry vs multiple
- Reduce storage and retrieval overhead

#### User Pattern Analysis
**File:** `convex/userPatterns.ts`
- Analyze eating patterns
- Predict meal suggestions
- Learn user preferences over time

#### Progressive Enhancement
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Performance monitoring

## Performance Targets üéØ

### Current Performance
- Simple "yes": ~200 tokens (was 2,000)
- After 20 messages: ~1,200 tokens (was 7,000)
- Photo analysis: 50% faster
- Response time: 2-3 seconds

### Target Performance
- Offline-capable food logging
- Sub-2 second response time
- 99.9% reliability
- < 500 tokens average per interaction

## Technical Debt üîß

1. **TypeScript Improvements**
   - Fix remaining type errors in settings page
   - Add proper types for all API responses
   - Remove `any` types where possible

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for optimization utilities
   - Integration tests for streaming
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Performance optimization guide

## Next Steps

1. Implement offline queue (highest priority for reliability)
2. Build quick food selector (best UX improvement)
3. Create analytics dashboard (measure optimization success)
4. Continuous monitoring and optimization

## Notes

- All optimizations should maintain backward compatibility
- Feature flags recommended for progressive rollout
- Monitor token usage closely after each deployment
- Keep user experience as top priority
