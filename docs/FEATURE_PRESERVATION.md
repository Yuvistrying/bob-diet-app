## Data & Schema ✅

All tables remain EXACTLY the same:

- ✅ userProfiles
- ✅ userPreferences
- ✅ weightLogs
- ✅ foodLogs
- ✅ chatHistory
- ✅ photoAnalyses
- ✅ contextCache
- ✅ dailyThreads
- ✅ pendingConfirmations
- ✅ calibrationHistory
- ✅ weeklyAnalytics
- ✅ conversationSummaries

## Future Features (Ready) ✅

| Feature          | Schema Status        | Implementation  |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Calibration      | ✅ Table exists      | Can add anytime |
| Weekly analytics | ✅ Table exists      | Can add anytime |
| Goal tracking    | ✅ goalHistory table | Can add anytime |
| Reminders        | ✅ In preferences    | Can add anytime |

## What Actually Changes

Only the plumbing, not the features:

### Removed (Redundant):

- `bobAgent.ts` - Convex Agent wrapper
- `agentActions.ts` - Duplicate chat endpoint
- Agent thread management - Replaced by threads.ts

### Kept (All Features):

- All database operations
- All context building
- All tools and logic
- All UI components
- All caching strategies
- All search capabilities

## Testing Script

```typescript
// Test every feature works identically
const tests = [
  // Basic logging
  "I had a banana",
  "yes",

  // Photo analysis
  "[upload photo]",
  "yes sure",

  // Weight tracking
  "I weigh 180 lbs today",

  // Progress check
  "how am I doing today?",

  // Similar meals
  "what did I have for lunch yesterday?",

  // Stealth mode
  "turn on stealth mode",

  // Context persistence
  "remember I don't like mushrooms",
  "what don't I like?", // Should remember
];
```

## Summary

The migration is like renovating your kitchen plumbing - same appliances, same features, just cleaner pipes. Bob's entire brain and all features remain 100% intact.
