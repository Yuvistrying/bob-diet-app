# Weight Logging Fix Documentation

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Weight logging was failing with infinite spinner and no database save  
**Root Cause**: Dynamic import in Convex runtime

## The Problem

When users tried to log their weight (e.g., "log 91kg", "I weigh 200 lbs"), Bob would:

1. Show "Running logWeight..." spinner indefinitely
2. Not respond with any text
3. Not save the weight to the database

## Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Symptoms

- Messages with `logWeight` tool calls but no content were appearing
- The tool call would hang forever
- No error messages in the UI

### 2. First Fix Attempt (UI Layer)

Added logic to skip rendering messages with only non-confirmation tool calls:

```typescript
// In chat/page.tsx
if (!confirmFoodCall && !message.content) {
  return null;
}
```

Result: Spinner disappeared but Bob stopped responding entirely.

### 3. Second Fix Attempt (Prompts)

Updated prompts to ensure Bob always responds with text:

```typescript
// In convex/prompts.ts
CRITICAL: ALWAYS include text in your response. Never send just a tool call...
For logWeight: ALWAYS respond with an encouraging message like "Logged your weight at 91kg! Keep tracking! ðŸ’ª"
```

Result: Bob started misinterpreting "log apple" as weight logging.

### 4. Third Fix Attempt (Better Prompts)

Clarified the distinction between food and weight logging:

```typescript
// "log apple", "log chicken" = FOOD logging, NOT weight
// "log 91kg", "weighed 200 lbs" = weight logging
```

Result: Bob called logWeight correctly but weight still wasn't saving.

### 5. Root Cause Discovery

Added detailed logging to the logWeight tool:

```typescript
console.log("[logWeight tool] Execute called with args:", args);
console.log("[logWeight tool] Weight:", args.weight, "Unit:", args.unit);
```

Server logs revealed:

```
[logWeight tool] Execute called with args: { weight: 91, unit: 'kg' }
[logWeight tool] ERROR calling mutation: Error: [Request ID: 0d115f2967f57612] Server Error
Uncaught TypeError: dynamic module import unsupported
    at handler (../convex/weightLogs.ts:145:41)
```

## The Solution

The issue was at line 145 in `convex/weightLogs.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (dynamic import - not supported by Convex)
const { checkGoalAchievement } = await import("./goalAchievements");

// AFTER (static import - works in Convex)
import { checkGoalAchievement } from "./goalAchievements";
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Convex doesn't support dynamic imports** - Always use static imports
2. **Tool execution errors don't bubble up to UI** - Need explicit error logging
3. **Prompt engineering matters** - Clear examples prevent misinterpretation
4. **Always check server logs** - UI symptoms don't tell the full story

## Testing Checklist

After this fix, verify:

- [ ] Weight logging completes without hanging
- [ ] Bob responds with encouraging text
- [ ] Weight appears in the diary
- [ ] "log [food]" is interpreted as food, not weight
- [ ] Goal achievement checking still works
